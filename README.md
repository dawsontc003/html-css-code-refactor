# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Your Task

Project Description
This application is a simple landing page for a marketing agency. This company offers full service for clients including: Search Enging Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

The primary goal of this project was to improve the accessibility of the application while maintaining the functionality and styling that was already in place. There were no features additions requested by the agency. This was one hundred percent an "under the hood" update.

Phase 1 - Updated HTML/CSS with Semantic Elements
The first challenge presented to me was replacing the

Phase 2 - Consolidated CSS Classes
There were many repeat classes that took up unnecessary space on the original stylesheet so I consolidated the stylesheet based lines of code that replicated styles 1:1.

Conclusion
This was a challenging project as I had to correct some file structure issues. It challenged my problem solving and googling skills. I feel that I did a great job for the client and believe that they would be very happy with the improved accessibility of the application and make the life of the next coder who works on their site much easier!
